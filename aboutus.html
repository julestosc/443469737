        <h1>ABOUT US</h1> 
        <p>
          This website was highlighly inspired by websites of other makeup brands, with the main source of inspiriation being Fenty Beauty's website, https://fentybeauty.com . </p>

        <p>I have used javascript to produce an image carosel, and I have also attempted to use javascript to produce a shopping cart and a search bar, although these have not been completed due to time constraints. I have furthermore created my own logo in order to help create the appropriate feel of the webpage. Due to time constraints, the navigation bar does not look as nice as originally planned, however it still carries out its function.
        </p>

        <p> Here are my original wireframes attached, which my page looks little like now, however it still carries a similar feel. </p>

        <div class="wireframes">
